# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a basic web development template for a password generator application. The project uses vanilla HTML, CSS (compiled from SCSS), and JavaScript with no build system or external dependencies.

## Repository Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the password generator interface structure
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for password generator functionality (currently empty)
- `style.scss`: SCSS source file for styling (currently empty)
- `style.css`: Compiled CSS output with source map support

## Development Environment

This is a static web project with SCSS compilation. The project uses:
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- SCSS for CSS preprocessing (compiled to `style.css`)
- Source maps for CSS debugging

## Development Workflow

To work with this project:
- Edit `style.scss` for styling changes
- Compile SCSS to CSS when making style changes
- Add JavaScript functionality to `script.js`
- Test by opening `index.html` in a web browser

## Current State

The project is in initial setup phase with:
- Basic HTML structure for a password generator
- Empty JavaScript and SCSS files ready for implementation
- CSS compilation setup with source mapping
